(#262) \r\n* Running as 64bit application on Windows is supported now (#234)\r\n* Polish translation is available now (#207)\r\n* CX II (/-T/CAS) calculators can now be emulated (#165)! However, with the current dumping programs you will not get a complete bootrom and booting the OS will fail.\r\n\r\n**Improvements:**\r\n* Multiple files can be sent in the Mobile UI and by dropping them into the main window on desktop (#279)\r\n Reimplemented emulation speed control: Now it's more accurate, especially on Windows\r\n* GitHub actions now performs automated builds for Android (armeabi-v7a and arm64-v8a in one APK), macOS and Windows (32bit and 64bit) on releases and pull requests (#283, #284, #285)\r\n* The \"installer\" for OS 4.5.3.14 (and later?) works now. It requires [fastboot RAM](https://hackspire.org/index.php?title=Memory-mapped_I/O_ports_on_CX#90030000_-_Fastboot_RAM) to persist state across reboots, which is now implemented.\r\n* More accurate emulation of the On button: It's now possible to enter Press-To-Test mode (#271)\r\n* Faster saving and loading of snapshots (#231)\r\n* More reliable USB file transfers\r\n* The debugger console now includes entered commands in the log\r\n* Support for PIE (position-independent executables) on x86_64. Previously, care needed to be taken that PIE was disabled, otherwise it would crash on start. (#211)\r\n* Building the JIT is disabled automatically if the platform does not support it (#197)\r\n* Firebird builds on FreeBSD now (#228, #248)\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes:**\r\n* File access on Android got fixed (#202 and its various duplicates)\r\n* Fix placement of keypad buttons in the touchpad area (#41)\r\n* Various fixes for the Mobile UI layout (#201)\r\n* The kit configuration page in the Mobile UI no longer causes the keyboard to pop up by default (#257)\r\n* Connecting with GDB on windows works now (#259, #260)\r\n* Some shades of grey were not displayed properly when emulating pre-CX models (#270)\r\n* Fix crash on AArch64/arm64 when executing certain instructions\r\n* The keypad reacts to touch events in the desktop version as well now (#292, #293)\r\n* Some places were no longer translated correctly after the introduction of language switching in 1.5\r\n* Keys could get stuck on focus changes. Now they're all released when the keypad loses focus (#287)\r\n* The Ctrl key now changes color when pressed\r\n* Emulation speed no longer remains unlimited after a failed file transfer\r\n\r\n_Repo for Arch, Debian, Fedora, Ubuntu and openSUSE: [via OBS](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3AVogtinator%3Afirebird-emu&package=firebird-emu&locale=en)._\r\n\r\nThere is work in progress to implement and improve support for running in the browser on Qt for WebAssembly (#294). A preview is available on https://nspire-emus.github.io/firebird/wasm/\n\nNOTE: BundleIdentifier changed in this version and automatic updates have been disabled until manual install occurs.",

The Library section offers a way to organize a large collection of games, demos and programs. The emulated hardware can be customized for each entry.\n\nThe Inbox provides a place to quickly try new programs. You can easily move the ones you want to keep to the library.\n\nTools mode allows attaching a cartridge like Action Replay or Final Cartridge and a collection of disks with your favorite tools, to help you dig into the programs, like back in the day.",

Well, you can play your music in iPod, get directions in Maps, surf the web in Safari, view the current weather in Weather, and much more. By the same token, no shortcuts were taken in fully fleshing out the operating system. You can change your background, adjust settings, search apps, et cetera. There are a few apps still not ready for primetime but don't worry, they're coming soon.\n\nWith OldOS, you no longer need to worry about securing a legacy iPhone to experience nostalgia \u2014 it's available on your daily driver.\n\nPart of the goal with OldOS is to enable anyone to understand how iOS works and demonstrate just how powerful SwiftUI truly is. For that reason, the entire app is open-sourced \u2014 enabling developers to learn about, modify, and add to the app. I thought building this over my last six or so months in high school and sharing it with the world would be a fun and productive endeavor.\n\nSpecial Features:\n* \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb Built almost entirely using SwiftUI.\n* \ud83c\udfa8 Designed to be as close to pixel-perfect as possible.\n* \ud83d\udcf1 Fully functional, perhaps even usable as a second OS.\n* \u2764\ufe0f A testament to the work of Apple employees of both the past and the present.\n* \ud83d\uddfa\ufe0f Fully open source for all to learn, modify, and build on.",
